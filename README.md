# GeoJSON Utils [deprecated]

For assistance converting between Esri's [Geoservices JSON](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#/Geometry_objects/02r3000000n1000000/) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) please check out our actively maintained projects:

* *[arcgis to geojson utils](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-to-geojson-utils)* - A standalone library to assist with conversion between the two formats

* *[Terraformer](http://terraformer.io/)* - Parsing, conversion, primitives and tools for manipulating and performing calculations on geometries.
